# 100 Days of Web Design

## Day 7 - React

Today I decided to use React again because I want to learn it better. I did another [Frontend Mentor]() project. This one was interactive card form. The goal was to make a form where the user can input their credit card and it will show up on the left side.

### What I need to learn

I had issues with verifying the form was filled out properly. I also had issues getting data from the form to the cards.

### How do I feel about React

I like react more than I used to, but I still wouldn't say it's my favorite framework I've used. I still have issues with the approach of bringing HTML into JavaScript, but I understand it better now.
